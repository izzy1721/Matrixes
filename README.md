# Matrixes
Using C++, construct a matrix class to be able to perform basic matrix arithmetic 
and also perform Gauss-Jordan Elimination to be able to apply class to future projects 
that use Markov Chains to predict patterns in user behavior. 

Functions incldued in this program:
  1) Addition of matricies
  2) Subtraction of matricies
  3) Multiplication of matricies
  4) Gauss-Jordan Elimination (in progress)
